## MAIL-SORT
Sorts, recalls, deletes, and manages email on command using OpenAI.


### Project Overview, Tasks, and Notes
1. Framework and basic GMail API functionality
2. Data storage (look into Redis?) using AI
3. AI command line application
4. AI UI application

Not that that easy of a project like I had anticipated. 
i forgot about the sheer magnitude of data we'll be working with because most people are email pigs
please please please don't make it so i have a $500 OpenAI bill. 
we need to use vectors and/or langchain to cut costs and code for efficiency of data recall
(do we actually though? I need to create a detailed outline to really breakdown how this is going to work)


1.  Framework
Sending, drafting, creating labels, searching, adding labels, (threads if necessary), deleting emails
2. Data Storage
Look into Redis software and vector storage. reference DCUBE for pipelining
3. AI application
This is the fun and easy part
4. AI UI application
I'm thinking of making it into a downloadable google playstore extension. that would be sick.
